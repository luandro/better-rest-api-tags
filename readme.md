## Description ##

A simple plugin that changes the normal `id` field, to `name` field when querying for tags on WP Rest Api.

Based on [stackoverflow answer](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/241814/wp-api-get-post-with-tag-names-instead-of-tag-ids) and a fork of simple [better-rest-api-featured-images](https://github.com/BraadMartin/better-rest-api-featured-images) plugin.

This plugin is on [on Github](https://github.com/Luandro/better-rest-api-tags "Better REST API Tags") and pull requests are always welcome. :)
